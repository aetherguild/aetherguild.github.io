					Address: Mukkulankatu 19, Lahti 15210 <br><br>
					The Slounge, also known as The Student Lounge, is the official guild room of Aether where students can students can come to hang out or work. It’s welcome to basically all students at Mukkula. The Slounge is currently open whenever a board member deems it acceptable and is present. It’s currently this way to make sure that the place is neat and tidy, and to keep everyone and everyone’s belongings safe.
				</p>
				<h2 id="three">Merchandise</h2>
				<p>The merchandise we sell can be collected via Slounge through a board member. They will check your eligibility and then give you the product.</p>
				<h2 id="four">Hobbyclubs and Committees</h2>
				<p>
					Hobby clubs are a part of university life. In hobby clubs you can find friends and take part in activities you enjoy.<br><br>
					You can also open up your own club if you feel like there aren’t any clubs related to the activities you enjoy. Unlike having just a friend group participate in an activity, through hobby clubs you can open up the possibility of meeting more people and having a more organized schedule, hobby clubs also give you benefits such as help from the student union when organizing it and expanding.<br><br>
					The instructions in English on how to make an association such as that can be found in the document <a href="https://ltky.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Guide-for-establishing-an-association-EN.pdf" style="color:rgb(0, 102, 255)"> document</a> published by LTKY.
				</p>
				<h2 id="five">Student advocacy</h2>
				<pbr>
					Student advocacy is a very important value of our guild. Feedback is very important for the whole student body. Being vocal about your studies is the only way to improve and fix possible existing problems. We also encourage students to be more active with the student union and even apply for positions there to better the student life on campus. <br><br>
					If you have any issues or want to discuss about advocacy then please contact either LTKY or our Academic Affairs Manager via email (<a href="mailto: academic@aetherguild.fi">academic@aetherguild.fi</a>)<br/>
