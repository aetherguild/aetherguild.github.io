AETHER is a new student guild based in the Lahti campus of LUT. AETHER was established in March 2022, under the guidance of the student union LTKY. AETHER stands for the Association of Engineering, Technological & Humanities Education and Research.

AETHER handles the well-being of all LUT students in Lahti and makes sure that none feels left out. AETHER is open to students of all nationalities, culture and backgrounds, so then they can have their voices heard and their opinions valued.
